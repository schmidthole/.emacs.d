#+TITLE: TAYMACS

Taylor's Emacs distribution. The idea of other "pre-built" Emacs distros is a
fun idea, but they have way too much going on and it's hard to cut them down
to exactly what you need. This distro approach tries to keep things organized
and easy to understand, without chasing through directories trying to find
random settings.

* Customization

Everything you need to cusomize is found in the good 'ol ~init.el~ file
inside the ~.emacs.d/~ directory. Everything starts from here no matter what.
Individual module customization can be found in the ~modules/~ directory.

After making changes to the ~init.el~, you'll need to restart emacs for
the changes to take effect.

* Modules

Taymacs is based on self contained modules that can be enabled/disabled
at will. These can be found in the ~tay/modules~ list. Simply
comment/uncomment to enable and disable modules.

The ~tay/external-packages~ variable can also be unset (it is set by default)
to enable/disable external package downloads from MELPA. If this is unset, only
built in emacs settings will be used where applicable and no packages will
be downloaded or enabled.

* Keybindings

Taymacs sticks to standard Emacs bindings with a few customizations. These are
all in one place within the ~init.el~ so they can be easily modified. The goal is
to not have to remember a ton of random keys to accomplish everyday tasks.
