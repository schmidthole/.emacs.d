* Dired
** Writeable Dired
~C-x C-q~ enables editing of a dired buffer
~C-c C-c~ commits edits

* Incremental Search
** isearch-occur
When in isearch-mode, use ~M-s o~ to enter an Occur buffer.
** isearch-query-replace
When in isearch-mode, use ~M-%~ to enter a query replace based on the current
search
* Selection
** Select Paragraph
~M-h~ Marks the entire paragraph. Using this binding multiple times expands the
selection to the next paragraph down
* Occur
** Editing
+ When in an Occur buffer, use ~e~ to enter editing mode.
+ Use ~C-c C-c~ to submit changes when finished. ~C-c C-q~ cancels.

* Project
The built-in Emacs project module does literally everything ivy/counsel did

| Keybinding | Function                            |
|------------+-------------------------------------|
| ~C-x p f~  | Open file in project                |
| ~C-x p b~  | Switch between only project buffers |
| ~C-x p D~  | Open dired buffer at project root   |
| ~C-x p g~  | Search for regexp in project        |
| ~C-x p k~  | Kill all buffers for project        |
| ~C-x p e~  | Eshell at project root              |
| ~C-x p s~  | Shell at project root               |

* VC Mode

VC mode works on "filesets" which means:

+ the current buffer
+ files marked in vc directory mode
+ marked files in dired

when operating on a vc fileset outside of vc directory mode, the
~C-x v~ prefix of most vc commands can be omitted.
